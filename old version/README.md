What's this?
============
Truth be told, I originally wrote this in [Processing] [1] and this is the code for it. The
prints seen in the action shot were generated by this Processing applet.

Then I thought better of submitting non-Python code to an application for a Python-specific
job, and I wrote the Python script you can find in the root of this repository. I'm including
this earlier version to be completely clear. The Python version is better just by virtue of 
written in Python.
